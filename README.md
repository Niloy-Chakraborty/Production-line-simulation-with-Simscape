# Production-line-simulation-with-Simscape
A simple demo for Prodution line simulation with Simscape.

More detailed content is in the documentation (Chinese description).

PS: 
Because the Step file of the robot model is slow to parse in Simulink. 
So if the computer performance is not good enough, it may affect the process, 
and even sometimes the computer  fails due to insufficient memory.
